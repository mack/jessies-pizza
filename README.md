# Jessies Pizza
I had this sketch file that I made, to just practice design, of a [local pizza company](https://www.jessyspizza.ca/). I thought I'd be cool to build it up from scratch.

## TODO (once layout of site is finished - basically the actual functionality of site)
* Set up database - Users, Sessions, Transactions, In-Process-Orders, Items, etc...
* Server to interact with db
* Apriori Algorithm - Determine rules to recommend products during checkout, based off of the frequent item set apriori computes
* Integrate stripe to process payments
* Administration Panel - Display graphs, transactions, various marketing analysis tools, manage users, etc
* Administration orders page - Very empty page, just displaying incoming orders for in-store employees
